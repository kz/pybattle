# PyBattle
PyBattle is a basic Pokemon-style fighting game built in Python 3.4. This was made in five hours for Whitgift School's ICT/Computing department to present during Open Morning on the next day.

## Design Brief
- Two-player hotseat multiplayer game
- Each player enters their names first
- Each player assigned a character
- They take turns with attacks
- The first one to reduce other player's HP to 0 wins
- Attacks have statistics such as strength and accuracy
